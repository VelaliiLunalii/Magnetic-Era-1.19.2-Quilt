# Coins 'n' Guns

Intricate and vanilla-friendly ranged weapons and ammo system.

## Description

This mod adds a whole new and complex new ranged weapon: the gilded pistol, while staying as balanced and vanilla-friendly as possible.

The pistol has 108 unique ways to use it through different mutually exclusive enchantments, ammo types and added effects.

<summary>Gilded Pistol</summary>

The core of this mod.

The gilded pistol is a ranged weapon not too dissimilar to crossbows.

It can hold 3 projectiles and keep them loaded for later use.

The pistol can use 3 different type of ammo listed in the "Coins" section.

Its projectiles' properties also depend on the coin pouch used, if one is used, detailed in the "Pouches" section.

The gilded pistol is crafted with a gold ingot, nugget, coin, a gilded pistol grip found with luck in iron crates while magnetic fishing or guaranteed when a crowbar is used on it, and a gilded pistol barrel found in the treasure's chest of piglin bastions or crafted with 3 netherite scraps and 3 iron ingots.

<summary>Fishing</summary>

Craft a magnet with iron, lapis lazuli and redstone dust.

It can be used to bring dropped items to you.

But more importantly, it can be crafted with a fishing rod to make a magnetic fishing rod.

A magnetic fishing rod works as a normal fishing rod.

However, instead of getting fish, it can catch coins, crates and philosopher stones.

<details>
<summary>Coins</summary>

Coins are the ammunition used by the gilded pistol.

There are 3 different coins, each with their own properties.

They can be crafted into each other with a 4 to 1 ratio like follows, and vice versa:

-   Copper - iron
-   Iron - gold

Copper coins are light and fast but deal the lowest damage at base 2 hearts.

Iron coins are heavy and slow but deal medium damage at base 3 hearts.

Gold coins are slightly slower and heavier than copper, with the same base 2 hearts of damage. However, they possess the ability to bounce off a block once, doubling their damage to base 4 hearts.

Finally, coins can be turned to emeralds when a philosopher stone is used in the other hand.

<details>
<summary>Pouches</summary>

Pouches are the way to store coins in bulk and to add effects to them when shot.

They can store up to 27 stacks of any combination of coins.

There are 4 different pouches with different effects:

-   Leather pouch: the base pouch. Doesn't add any effect to coins but is the base for all other pouches
-   Crimson pouch: the nether pouch. Adds 1 heart of base damage to coins and burn targets for 2 seconds
-   Ender pouch: the end pouch. Coins are no longer affected by gravity nor are slowed down by water. Additionally, they break blocks on hit and bring back dropped items on hit
-   Sculk pouch: the deep dark pouch. Coins direct all other shot coins to the hit target on hit
